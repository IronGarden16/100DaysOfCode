## Day 0: Preparation
I've been coding a lot in the past few years but it was inconsistent.
I wasn't coding everyday and wasn't learning really advanced things like
complex algorithm etc. So I decided to join the 100DaysOfCode Challenge to
make it a habbit. I'm thinking of instead of tweeting my progress, I wanted
to blog my progess on medium. I haven't started the blog yet but I will. 
I'm still clearing out my schedule so I can start clean. I hope this turn
out well. Happy coding!

## Day 1: IDE Setup (May 7, 2018 Monday)
I've setup my VS code, added some plugins to support python which is the
language I will use on this journey. Although I might try a little bit of go
along the way. I have this interest in go but I still want to see the go's 
community so grow more than it already is to make me consider. I've tested
some of VS's plugins that has linters, debuggers etc. support. It seems like
an interesting stuffs. I will dive into this much more further in the
following days.

## Day 2: Python and Django setup (May 8, 2018 Tuesday)
I've setup my python and django for VS Code. I installed some pep8 and 
pylint_django for my django support. Although pep8 is annoying me in which
it forces me to use only **_80 characters per line_** but I'm accustomed in using
__*120 characters*__. I haven't looked for a solution yet but I will. I still haven't
Done anything aside from intensive configuration of my IDE for python and 
django. I'll be making sure that I'll be coding tomorrow. I have an idea on mind
but that's an old and useless idea but I'll be doing it for the purpose of learning
I'll be posting my project here on github too.

## Day 3: A failed attempt (May 9, 2018 Wednesday)
I tried making a Restful API using Django rest framework and I just couldn't make
it work. I tried looking for tutorials but nothing works. I'll try reading more
tutorials until it works.

## Day 4: Worked on a different project (May 11, 2018 Friday)
I started working on a portfolio and focused on that today. I'll be logging my
activity on that project if I don't have done anything on the project this is 
supposed to be in. Haha. Kinda cheating but not really since its not a part of
my work and neither it is part of school project. So it does count

## Day 5: Worked on the other project again (May 13, 2018 Sunday)
I added a section to it, and adding more to it on the following days.
