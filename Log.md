# Day 0: Preparation
I've been coding a lot in the past few years but it was inconsistent.
I wasn't coding everyday and wasn't learning really advanced things like
complex algorithm etc. So I decided to join the 100DaysOfCode Challenge to
make it a habbit. I'm thinking of instead of tweeting my progress, I wanted
to blog my progess on medium. I haven't started the blog yet but I will. 
I'm still clearing out my schedule so I can start clean. I hope this turn
out well. Happy coding!

# Day 1: IDE Setup
I've setup my VS code, added some plugins to support python which is the
language I will use on this journey. Although I might try a little bit of go
along the way. I have this interest in go but I still want to see the go's 
community so grow more than it already is to make me consider. I've tested
some of VS's plugins that has linters, debuggers etc. support. It seems like
an interesting stuffs. I will dive into this much more further in the
following days.
