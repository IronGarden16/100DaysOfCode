# Day 0: Preparation
I've been coding a lot in the past few years but it was inconsistent.
I wasn't coding everyday and wasn't learning really advanced things like
complex algorithm etc. So I decided to join the 100DaysOfCode Challenge to
make it a habbit. I'm thinking of instead of tweeting my progress, I wanted
to blog my progess on medium. I haven't started the blog yet but I will. 
I'm still clearing out my schedule so I can start clean. I hope this turn
out well. Happy coding!
